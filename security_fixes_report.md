# Security Fixes Report

## Overview
This report documents 3 critical bugs identified and fixed in the Mnemosine Backend codebase. The bugs included security vulnerabilities and logic errors that could impact the application's security, performance, and reliability.

## Bug 1: Authentication Logic Flaw (Security Vulnerability)

### Issue Description
**File**: `backend/app/core/security/auth.py`
**Function**: `authenticate_user()`
**Severity**: High - Security & Performance

The authentication function was hashing the admin password from settings on every authentication attempt. This created two problems:
1. **Performance Issue**: Password hashing is computationally expensive (bcrypt is designed to be slow). Performing this operation on every login attempt creates unnecessary CPU load.
2. **Security Anti-pattern**: Passwords should be hashed once during storage, not during authentication.

### Original Code
```python
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    """Authenticate user credentials (single user system)."""
    if username != settings.ADMIN_USERNAME:
        return False

    # In a single-user system, we hash the password from settings
    hashed_password = get_password_hash(settings.ADMIN_PASSWORD)
    return verify_password(password, hashed_password)
```

### Fix Applied
```python
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    """Authenticate user credentials (single user system)."""
    if username != settings.ADMIN_USERNAME:
        return False

    # Direct password comparison - the hashed password should be stored in settings
    # For security, the admin password should be hashed once and stored
    return verify_password(password, settings.ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH)
```

### Impact
- **Performance**: Eliminates expensive hashing operation during authentication
- **Security**: Follows proper password storage practices
- **Reliability**: Reduces authentication response time

## Bug 2: Hardcoded Default Credentials (Security Vulnerability)

### Issue Description
**File**: `backend/app/config/settings.py`
**Variables**: `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
**Severity**: Critical - Security

The application had hardcoded default credentials that could easily be forgotten and left unchanged in production environments:
- Default username: "admin"
- Default password: "admin"

This is a critical security vulnerability as attackers could gain administrative access using these well-known default credentials.

### Original Code
```python
# Single user authentication (no database required)
ADMIN_USERNAME: str = "admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD: str = "admin"
```

### Fix Applied
```python
# Single user authentication (no database required)
ADMIN_USERNAME: str = Field(..., description="Admin username - must be set via environment variable")
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH: str = Field(..., description="Admin password hash - must be set via environment variable")
```

### Additional Security Measures
Added validation for the password hash format:
```python
@field_validator("ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH")
@classmethod
def validate_admin_password_hash(cls, v: str) -> str:
    """Validate admin password hash format."""
    if not v or not v.startswith("$2b$"):
        raise ValueError("ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH must be a valid bcrypt hash")
    return v
```

### Impact
- **Security**: Eliminates default credentials vulnerability
- **Compliance**: Forces administrators to set secure credentials
- **Validation**: Ensures proper password hash format

## Bug 3: Unsafe Rate Limiting Exception Handling (Logic Error)

### Issue Description
**File**: `backend/app/core/security/limiter.py`
**Function**: `rate_limit_exceeded_handler()`
**Severity**: Medium - Logic Error

The rate limiting exception handler used unsafe attribute access that could lead to:
1. **Type Errors**: If `retry_after` is not numeric
2. **Unreasonable Values**: No bounds checking on retry_after values
3. **Missing HTTP Headers**: Missing standard `Retry-After` header

### Original Code
```python
def rate_limit_exceeded_handler(request: Request, exc: RateLimitExceeded) -> Response:
    """Custom rate limit exceeded handler."""
    # Get retry_after from the exception if available, otherwise default to 60
    retry_after = getattr(exc, 'retry_after', 60)
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=429,
        content={
            "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
            "detail": f"Too many requests. Limit: {exc.detail}",
            "retry_after": retry_after,
        },
    )
```

### Fix Applied
```python
def rate_limit_exceeded_handler(request: Request, exc: RateLimitExceeded) -> Response:
    """Custom rate limit exceeded handler."""
    # Safely get retry_after from the exception with proper validation
    retry_after = 60  # Default value
    
    if hasattr(exc, 'retry_after') and exc.retry_after is not None:
        try:
            retry_after = int(exc.retry_after)
            # Ensure retry_after is reasonable (between 1 and 3600 seconds)
            retry_after = max(1, min(retry_after, 3600))
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            retry_after = 60  # Fall back to default if conversion fails
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=429,
        content={
            "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
            "detail": f"Too many requests. Limit: {exc.detail}",
            "retry_after": retry_after,
        },
        headers={"Retry-After": str(retry_after)},
    )
```

### Impact
- **Reliability**: Prevents crashes from invalid retry_after values
- **Standards Compliance**: Adds proper HTTP `Retry-After` header
- **Security**: Bounds checking prevents abuse of retry times

## Recommendations for Further Security Improvements

1. **Environment Configuration**: Update deployment documentation to specify how to generate secure password hashes
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing distributed rate limiting for multiple server instances
3. **Input Validation**: Review all user inputs for potential injection vulnerabilities
4. **Logging**: Add security event logging for failed authentication attempts
5. **HTTPS**: Ensure all production deployments use HTTPS with proper TLS configuration

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Authentication Tests**: Test authentication with various invalid inputs
2. **Rate Limiting Tests**: Verify rate limiting behavior under load
3. **Security Tests**: Perform penetration testing on authentication endpoints
4. **Configuration Tests**: Validate application fails securely with missing environment variables

## Summary

- **Bug 1**: Fixed authentication performance and security anti-pattern
- **Bug 2**: Eliminated hardcoded default credentials vulnerability  
- **Bug 3**: Improved rate limiting exception handling robustness
